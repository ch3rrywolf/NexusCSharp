/* ### 1.Use if statements ###*/
// The if statement checks the value of a bool.
// When the value is true, the statement following the if executes. 
// this process of checking conditions and executing statements based on those conditions is powerful.
int a = 5;
int b = 6;
b = 3;
if (a + b > 10) // nothing is printed. condition is false
    Console.WriteLine("The answer is greater than 10.");
